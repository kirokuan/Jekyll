Recently, I read the online book ["Microservice vs Service-Oriented Achetecture (SOA)"](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/microservices-vs-service-oriented/9781491975657/)

It's small book corpised of 5 sector only, it doesn't explain two concept deeply, but focus on the differences between two.

and it compares the differences of the archeture:

|microservice | SOA|
|:--------|:--------|
|share as little as possible | shared as much as possible|
|smaller, well-partitioned web-based systems  | large, complex, enterprise-wide systems |
|protocol-aware heterogeneous interoperability|protocol-agnostic heterogeneous interoperability|
||contract decoupling|
