PyCon Tw 2016 held during 6/3-6/5, somehow 6/4 is not holiday, and I have to attend the class. Although I programmed with Python selodomly, mainly use it in assignment.

First of all, the website is very impressive. It's built with [Hackfoldr](https://hackfoldr.org/about), which can make someone without any html basic able to make a website with google excel. 
Besides, it embeds the [hackMD](https://hackmd.io/)

And it also use gitter chatroom , which make the imformation express more synchronously.

## Day1

### Keynote By Andrey Tang: 
    She addressed some previous demostration held around presidential hell, and how the software can assist them like clarifying the rumor. She said that some protection failed due to flooding rumor and the demostrator can't distinguish them.
    The other more impressive one is that there was a technical minister, whose aim was recuiting the elites into government, after his reassign, the next minister got a opposite aim, which is to make the data open, make it autherize the citizens to do what they want.  

### Immutable InfraStructure , take Docker Kolla as example.
    I am not familirt with Docker, but basic idea is that the it's easier to version control the image, but to creating image upon change may also takes time.

### Robot Framework:  
    The lecture only introduced some basic function about robot framework, since the time is limited, the lecturer didn't demostrate their work.
    The lecturer said that he think most serious problem is people, even though he think the syntax of robot framework is strict enough, there is still some could misspell or name the variable unproperly.

### Interactive device combining with Art: 
    The lecturer built the interactive device and combine it with art. He used Django installed in Raspberry. And He made lot of work about deploy to the machine,
    There may be some troublesome situations in exhibition, like the unstable network, power outage.
