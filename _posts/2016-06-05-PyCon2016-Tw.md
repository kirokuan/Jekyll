PyCon Tw 2016 held during 6/3-6/5, somehow 6/4 is not holiday, and I have to attend the class. Although I programmed with Python selodomly, mainly use it in assignment.

First of all, the website is very impressive. It's built with [Hackfoldr](https://hackfoldr.org/about), which can make someone without any html basic able to make a website with google excel. 
Besides, it embeds the [hackMD](https://hackmd.io/)

And it also use gitter chatroom , which make the imformation express more synchronously.
