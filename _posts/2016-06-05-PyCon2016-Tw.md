PyCon Tw 2016 held during 6/3-6/5, somehow 6/4 is not holiday, and I have to attend the class. Although I programmed with Python selodomly, mainly use it in assignment.

First of all, the website is very impressive. It's built with [Hackfoldr](https://hackfoldr.org/about), which can make someone without any html basic able to make a website with google excel. 
Besides, it embeds the [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/)

And it also use gitter chatroom , which make the imformation express more synchronously.

## Day1

### Keynote By Andrey Tang: 
    She addressed some previous demostration held around presidential hell, and how the software can assist them like clarifying the rumor. She said that some protestion failed due to flooding rumor and the demostrator can't distinguish them.
    The other more impressive one is that there was a technical minister, whose aim was recuiting the elites into government, after his reassign, the next minister got a opposite aim, which is to make the data open, make it autherize the citizens to do what they want.  

### Immutable InfraStructure , take Docker Kolla as example.
    I am not familiar with Docker, but basic idea is that the it's easier to version control the image, but to creating image upon change may also takes time.

### Reactive Programming
    Actually, I just had a lecture about Reactive Programming in Javascript on Wed. I think the coding style is quite similar despite of the difference of language.

### Robot Framework:  
    The lecture only introduced some basic function about robot framework, since the time is limited, the lecturer didn't demostrate their work.
    The lecturer said that he think most serious problem is people, even though he think the syntax of robot framework is strict enough, some could misspell or name the variable inproperly.

### Interactive device combining with Art: 
    The lecturer built the interactive device and combine it with art. He used Django installed in Raspberry. And He made lot of work about deploying to the machine,
    There may be some troublesome situations in exhibition, like the unstable network, power outage. Since there are serveral machines, he implemented some batch managed system, like shutdown all or 

This speech made me have different view to the Interactive device, most of us may not able to relate technical and art together, or said few made his application applied in the art.

## Day3

### Pixnet Enginner introduced about how to build their keyword wizard.
    He used jieba and word2vec to create a Chinese word analysis

### Analysis of Chinese Lycics: 
    Use Scrapy to crawl the lyrics from website,and use jieba to tokenize the Chinese term.
    
### Keynote :
    I think this should be the only topic related soft skill of communication. 

** Conclusion

Python can be applied in various ways, including building website, geo map,scentific calculation...etc. Nowadays, the data mining/machine learning is still most popular.
