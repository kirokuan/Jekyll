Recently, I need to make a unit-test for a WSP(Web Site Project), since converting it to a WAP(Web Application Project) may be troublesome.

Eventually, WSP can be compiled to dll, so we can test the App_code.dll.

{% highlight xml linenos %}
{% raw %}

  <PropertyGroup>
    <PreBuildEvent>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\aspnet_compiler.exe -p $(SolutionDir)WebSiteName -v / -f -u $(SolutionDir)PrecompiledWeb</PreBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight xml %}

WebSiteName is the name of website project, and output folder is called PrecompiledWeb. So in the test project, only we need is that we add reference to PrecompiledWeb/bin/App_code.dll.
