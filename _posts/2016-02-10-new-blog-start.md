Finally, Jekyll can run in github ,which i tried before but failed. Today I spent 4 or 5 hrs to make it work. 

I got strunk at first place that the page can't be rendered properly, eventually i came out that there should not be blank before 3 dash marks. And i tried another theme, it looks good and support to highlight programming syntax which i need most . However it is little troublesome to copy template and edit it whenever i need to publish new posts. And there is no Chinese input in my virtual box, that's why  i can only type in English.

Anyway, i will try to move some notes i used to make in my own site.
