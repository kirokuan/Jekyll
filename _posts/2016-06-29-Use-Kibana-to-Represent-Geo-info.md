description: Use Kibana, Logstash to analyse log and build a Geo ditribution 
---

I tried to use ELK( ElasticSearch, Logstash and Kibana) to analyse the log and pushed them to Kibana and build a representation.

Most steps are listed in the some tutorials like [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-map-user-location-with-geoip-and-elk-elasticsearch-logstash-and-kibana)
and I aimed at analysing the iis log.
